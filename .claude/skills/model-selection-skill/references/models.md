# Model Selection Reference

| Model | Strengths | When to pick |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5** (Released November 24, 2025) | State-of-the-art coding performance on SWE-bench (80.9%), first to break 80%; handles ambiguity without guidance, debugs multi-system bugs autonomously, excels in agentic tasks.[1][9] | Choose for complex coding, debugging, or agent workflows requiring high autonomy and precision; ideal for enterprise coding leaders or tasks previously impossible for prior models.[1][4][9] |
| **Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5** | Strong performance in supported platforms; positioned as a mid-tier option with enhanced capabilities over predecessors.[1] | Select for balanced general tasks needing reliability without Opus-level intensity; suitable for Pro/Max subscribers in everyday workflows.[1][6] |
| **OpenAI GPT-5.2-Codex** (and holiday variant GPT-5.2-Codex-XMas) | Advanced coding assistance with increased usage limits; supports agent standards like AGENTS.md for project-specific instructions.[6][2][3] | Pick for coding agents, workflow automation, or developer tools emphasizing interoperability; use holiday boosts for high-volume coding until Jan 1, 2026.[6][7] |
| **OpenAI open-weight models** | Accessible via platforms; focuses on broad compatibility and ambient AI integration.[1] | Opt for cost-effective, open deployments in interoperable ecosystems or when proprietary access is unnecessary.[1] |
